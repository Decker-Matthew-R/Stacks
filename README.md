Stacks
This was a multi part problem. Problem one created a class that allowed you to perform push, pop, peek, and size functions. The second problem was a test program that allowed us to perform the operations programmed in problem 1.

Problem 3 used stacks to determine if the user string input was a palindrome.

The fourth problem ased the user to enter a postfix expressed. The program would than determine the actual value and display it to the user.
